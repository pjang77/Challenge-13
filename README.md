I understand that this HW wants a video submitted but I was having difficulty with my screen recorder in order to show the different API endpoints in action. I'm hoping that the ddscription I put above as well as the way that I have organized my code will be enough to show that I understand what I was asked to do to get good marks on other sections of the how but of course not the the 37% for the video submission.
